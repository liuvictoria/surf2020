  Women and Medicine in Victorian Novels
authors: >
  Victoria Liu
Overview: >
  This website is dedicated to tracking my thoughts, reports, and cool graphics for my
  2020 SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship) at Caltech. I am working with Professor
  Kevin Gilmartin to explore how women and medicine interacted during the Victorian era.
  I am interested in exploring both the professionalization of predominantly female-occupied
  medical careers, as well as how "deviant" women were stigmatized in society and literature.
Proposal:  >
  A short summary of your work goes here. Think "significance statement".
