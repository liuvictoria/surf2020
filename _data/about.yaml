  Women and Medicine in Victorian Novels

Overview: >
  This website is dedicated to tracking my thoughts, reports, and cool graphics for my
  2020 SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship) at Caltech. I am working with Professor
  Kevin Gilmartin to explore how women and medicine interacted during the Victorian era.
  I am interested in exploring both the professionalization of predominantly female-occupied
  medical careers, as well as how "deviant" women were stigmatized in society and literature.
Proposal:  >
 In the 1800’s, the Industrial Revolution caused a dramatic shift in English demographics—more people 
 were coming into the cities from the rural areas, and this urbanization created new social and health 
 issues that England had never seen before. Overcrowding and sanitation issues caused an explosion in 
 transmissible diseases, while society’s increasingly negative view of non-productive citizens caused 
 asylums to fill up. Urbanization made it necessary for the healthcare system to come under more centralized, 
 municipal control, while medical providers attempted to gain prestige by professionalizing their training 
 and forming their own exclusive societies. Within the fast-changing Victorian landscape of medicine, this 
 SURF project seeks to understand where women fit it in. I hope to investigate women’s roles as both healthcare 
 providers and recipients. The research will focus on three main aspects: 1) how the traditionally female roles 
 of nursing and midwifery became professionalized and the difficulties in such professionalization, 2) what types 
 of medical resources middle class and pauper women had, and to what extent they relied on self-care, and 3) how the 
 Victorian concept of insanity related to femininity and the treatment of the “deviant” female. After discussing with 
 my advisor, Professor Gilmartin, we agreed that this research project will not start with an overarching thesis 
 towards which everything must converge. Rather, especially at the beginning, the project will attempt to map out 
 of the collective and individual Victorian female narrative with respect to medicine. As the project proceeds, I 
 may find myself drawn to particular aspects or trends and decide to research those in more depth—perhaps, I will even
 be able to formulate some sort of “thesis” in time for the final SURF presentation. My ultimate goal in the project 
 is to gain a deeper understanding of how medicine, society, literature, and the female experience intersect. I plan to
 use both secondary sources, such as factual literature, as well as primary sources, such as contemporaneous fictional 
 writing and periodicals. The use of periodicals will be especially interesting since I will be examining both medical
 periodicals and periodicals for lay people (that include medical advice or advertisements), and it will be interesting 
 to compare the type of information presented in each. In addition, I hope to examine the reciprocity between literature 
 and medicine, to analyze both how the language of the Victorian era influenced medical texts and how medical beliefs 
 influenced literature of the time. Before delving into primary sources, however, I will first browse through more secondary 
 sources to gain a better understanding of the Victorian healthcare landscape and current branches of medical literature and 
 history research. I will be consulting with my advisor, as well as Professor Gilmore (who is also an expert in the Victorian era),
 about good examples of factual literature regarding Victorian medicine. Please click [here] (https://liuvictoria.github.io)
