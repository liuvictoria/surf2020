# August 4-5, 2020

Please note, there was a power outage due to Hurricane Isaias, and so I couldn’t work for most of August 4. Therefore, I am combining the stuff I did on both August 4 and 5 together.

### Chapter 5

Some ways in which the teaching clinic, which was situated in the hospital, differed from the hospital:

1. The clinic was preoccupied with nosological organization of diseases, making specialization impossible (and also making the clinic inaccessible to all patients).
2. The clinic was focused on using language to convey the illnesses, thus creating a “synthetic” language surrounding the patient and illness.
3. In the hospital, the patient is treated as a subject, the case itself. In the clinic, the patient is an object being treated by the subjects (aka doctors), and the main focus on the disease, which happens to manifest itself in the patient. This is better described as follows: “In the clinic, on the other hand, one is dealing with diseases that happen to be afflicting this or that patient: what is present is the disease itself, in the body that is appropriate to it, which is not that of the patient, but that of its truth. It is ‘the different diseases that serve as the text’ [26]: the patient is only that through which the text can be read, in what is sometimes a complicated and confusing state. In the hospital, the patient is the subject of his disease, that is, he is a case; in the clinic, where one is dealing only with examples, the patient is the accident of his disease, the transitory object that it happens to have seized upon.
4. The clinic was focused on enlightening the ignorant, with a hierarchy of knowledge.


## Interesting quotations:

### Chapter 3


“...two authorities are 
juxtaposed: the ordinary, which, because of the distribution of aid, 
involves a continuous supervision of the social space with a system 
of highly medicalized regional centres; and the extraordinary, which 
is made up of discontinuous, exclusively medical spaces, structured 
according to the model of scientific knowledge. Disease is thus 
caught in a double system of observation: there is a gaze that does not distinguish it from, but re-absorbs it into, all the other social ills 
to be eliminated; and a gaze that isolates it, with a view to 
circumscribing its natural truth.”

**My thoughts**: It seems like there were two gazes (public and professional) that isolated the patient from their disease, choosing to treat the disease as its own entity.


“For reasons that are bound up with the history of modern man, 
the clinic was to remain, in the opinion of most thinkers, more 
closely related to the themes of light and liberty—which, in fact, had 
evaded it—than to the discursive structure in which, in fact, it 
originated.”

**My thoughts**: Although the clinic was supposedly tied with ideals of liberty, Foucault argues that its closed nature (aka so many requirements and tuition to become a doctor) actually makes it quite antithetical to the themes of light and liberty.

### Chapter 4

“Not only the names of diseases, not only the grouping 
of systems were not the same; but the fundamental perceptual codes 
that were applied to patients’ bodies, the field of objects to which 
observation addressed itself, the surfaces and depths traversed by the 
doctor’s gaze, the whole system of orientation of this gaze also 
varied.”

**My thoughts**: Describing how the medical gaze in the 1700’s (in France) affected the spatial dimensions of disease as it related to the patient.

### Chapter 5

The French Revolution called for the abolishment of the Faculte and universities, on the basis that these bastions of knowledge were too privileged and privatized; reformers suggested that if the revolution was successful, there would be no need of these institutions anymore. In the following quotations, most are detailing the changes that were proposed during the Convention and afterwards; since my project is focused on Victorian British literature, most of these historical remarks on France are not completely relevant, so I am focusing on philosophical thoughts regarding medicine instead?

“The abolition 
of both the old hospital structures and the university made possible, 
then, the immediate communication of teaching within the concrete 
field of experience; furthermore, it effaced dogmatic language as an 
essential stage in the transmission of truth. The silencing of 
university speech (la parole universitaire) and the abolition of the 
professorial chair made it possible, beneath the old language, in the 
obscurity of a partly blind practice, driven this way and that by 
circumstances, for a language without words, possessing an entirely new syntax, to be formed: a language that did not owe its truth to 
speech but to the gaze alone. In this hasty recourse to the clinic, 
another clinic, with an entirely new configuration, was born.”

“What makes medicine, 
thus understood, a corpus of knowledge of use to all citizens is its 
immediate relationship with nature: instead of being, like the old 
Faculty, the locus of an esoteric, bookish corpus of knowledge, the 
new school would be ‘the temple of nature’; there one would learn 
not what the old masters thought they knew, but that form of truth 
open to all that is manifested in everyday practice: ‘Practice will be 
linked to theoretical precepts. Pupils will be practised in chemical 
experiments, anatomical dissections, surgical operations, and in the 
use of machinery. Read little, see much, and do much.’ They will 
learn as they practise, at the patient’s bedside: instead of useless 
physiologies, they will learn the true ‘art of curing’ [23].”

“What characterized this reform was not only that the balance of 
medicine was shifted further in the direction of the clinic, but that 
this was also counterbalanced by much broader theoretical teaching. 
Once one defined a practical experiment carried out on the patient 
himself, one insisted on the need to relate particular knowledge to an 
encyclopaedic whole.”’

**My thoughts**: Interestingly, although there was an emphasis on “practical” knowledge through observation at the clinic, this was still supplemented by a need for the “encyclopedic whole,” thus supporting the development of the medical gaze that is based on esoteric knowledge.


“this 
universal concern for information revealed what was no doubt its 
true preoccupation: to regroup those doctors whose competence had 
been validated by ordinary studies, and to militate in favour of a new definition of the limits of the free practice of medicine: ‘Let 
me not be permitted to conceal from history the memory of those 
disastrous times when an impious and barbarous hand smashed in 
France the altars devoted to the cult of medicine! They have 
disappeared, those bodies whose ancient fame attested to their long­standing successes’ [35].”

**My thoughts**: Doctors and officials were horrified at the lack of accountability and quacks that killed thousands of French citizens during the Revolution. Here, they proposed a channel for knowledge amongst medical professionals, as a means for easy communication; however, Foucault suggests that their real agenda was to close off medicine again, to the elitely trained.

Vitet’s proposal in Year XI: “The only real 
innovation was the requirement of a clinical test: ‘The candidate 
doctor will expound at the patient’s bedside the character of the 
species of disease and its treatment.’ Thus, for the first time, the 
criteria of theoretical knowledge and those of a practice that can be 
linked only to experience and custom were found together in a single 
institutional framework. ”

“Taking industry in the wide sense of the term, Cabanis 
distinguishes between two categories of objects. There are objects 
whose nature is such that the consumers are themselves the judges of 
their utility... But there are also industries whose object and value do not depend 
upon a collective decision: either these objects are among those that 
serve to determine the market value of other objects (precious 
metals, for example), or they relate to the human individual, about 
whom any error may prove fatal.”


*Foucault outlines some ways in which medicine, the clinic, and the doctor/patient relationship actually changed, following the reforms in the years after the Revolution.*

“The old difference between physicians 
and surgeons, between the internal and the external, what one 
knows and what one sees, is made secondary by this new distinction. 
It is no longer a question of a difference in the object, or the way in 
which the object is manifested, but of a difference of level in the 
experience of the knowing subject.”

“The practice required of the officer of 
health was a controlled empiricism: a question of knowing what to 
do after seeing; experience was integrated at the level of perception, 
memory, and repetition, that is, at the level of the example. In the 
clinic, it was a question of a much more subtle and complex 
structure in which the integration of experience occurred in a gaze 
that was at the same time knowledge, a gaze that exists, that was 
master of its truth, and free of all example, even if at times it had 
made use of them. Practice would be opened up to the officers of
health, but the doctors would reserve the initiation into the clinic to 
themselves”
