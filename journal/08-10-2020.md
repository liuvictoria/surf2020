Spent a while trying to figure out the next Victorian novel to read; I read summaries online for a few Dickens books and settled on *Dombey and Son*, since it touches upon multiple themes I am interested in—family, marriage (both arranged and for love), characterization of the “deviant woman” / fallen woman, prostitution, nursing, medicine (although only for male doctors, it seems) and child care.

Started reading *Dombey and Son*; it’s such a long book! Hoping that I can finish it within 2.5 weeks, and hopefully get another book or two in before SURF ends.
