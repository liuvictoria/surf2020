Continued reading chapters 3/4 of Holmes’ *Fictions of Affliction*

## Chapter 3 Wilkie Collins and the Disabling of Melodrama

### *Hide and Seek* by Wilkie Collins

In contrast to *Last Days of Pompei*, Dickens’ novels, and Yonge/Craik, **Collins portrays a disabled female character who is both an object of desire *and* an object of pity.** In other words, being sexual does not result in punishment, and the character still elicits pity due to her disability. (Yay, more progressive!)

The main character, Madonna, is deaf after a circus accident, and the novel focuses on finding her long-lost relatives. During a circus “performance” (really just spectators ogling at how deaf/dumb she is), ten-year-old Madonna captures the attention of Blyth, who then adopts her. However, **their interaction is described in erotically physical terms, with a critic suggesting, “if ever man was in love with a child at first sight, he was that man.”**

**Indeed, the novel’s very first description of Madonna in the present day is in sexually suggestive terms as well**—the novel introduces us to Madonna by describing a mysterious girl living in Blythe’s painting studio, suggesting that she may be “the other woman.” It is not until the readers have a sufficientaly sexualized image of Madonna that we learn she is Blythe’s adoptive daughter.

There are other instances of Madonna’s sexuality, even though some of it is a little disturbing since they are descriptions of a ten-year-old; for example,when she first becomes deaf, her voice becomes all deep and husky, almost moaning-like; in addition, she is enraptured every time she is with nature.

**The novel creates a space for Madonna to find romance in a way that is not judged or questioned by society.** She falls in love with Zack, and they have a nice romance. **In the end, the romance doesn’t work out, but not because Madonna is disabled; rather, the two find out they are half-siblings, and it is incest, not disability, that breaks the relationship.**

### *Poor Miss Finch* by Wilkie Collins

**Lucilla Finch is blind, and her sexuality and happiness is almost defined through her blindness.** Indeed, when Lucilla gets her blindness successfully treated by a surgeon, she loses her “thrill tingles” and her “old delightful sensation” of love. When she loses her sight again, she exclaims, “Thank God, I am blind.” Of course, this is probably very related to the fact that Lucilla is upper class and thus does not *need* her sight to survive, and she is able to enjoy her sightlessness, which seems to enhance her other senses.

**Lucilla is also described as very sexual; one recalls to mind her delight at asking her friend to act as a voyeur for an intimate kiss with her timid lover.** Lucilla is not punished for being blind and sexual, and there are no connections to fallen or deviant women. **In the end, she marries her lover and even has two biological children, neither of which are deaf.** This is pretty much as extreme as an author could go; so far we haven’t seen (in our discussion) any other novels where there is no editorial criticism for a disabled female mother.


### Criticisms of Wilkie Collins

 Critics often compared Collins to Dickens; however, since Dickens treated his disabled characters more conservatively (i.e. no fulfilling marriage plots for disabled females), critics were more comfortable with these novels. In contrast, they often went after Collins, suggesting that he was only writing about disabled people as a reflection of his own chronic illness. Some also suggested that novels about disease / disability were a lower type of literature compared to novels with able-bodied people because disabled people were inherently a lower class.

## Chapter 4 An Object for Compassion; an Enemy to the State
**Holmes suggests that disabled people were viewed in a binary fashion: those who were innocently disabled and thus deserved charity, and those who were simply faking their disability and deserved to be punished/ reformed.** Oftentimes, disabled children (males and females), who were already considered dependent on society, were considered innocently helpless, while grown-up men who begged or thieved were considered vile.

**This dichotomy of feeling reflected Victorian sentiments of simultaneous pity and disgust at disabled people—the simultaneous need to feel sympathy / give charity *and* the involuntary repulsion/ anxiety of wasted resources. This also reflected the melodramatic portrayals of disabled people; there are only extremely good and extremely bad people, and nothing in between.**

Of course, there is an in-between, namely, that of the disabled working man who attempts to work honestly for a living. Indeed, **the boundary between the innocent boy and the malevolent beggar man is unclear as well**, when one considers that the pitiable boy may very well become the begging man in a few years. In addition, both characters are related by their disability and their distance from the traditional workforce.

**Educational documents often emphasized the dramatic, emotional element of the young, disabled child.** Advertisements for blind/deaf/otherwise disabled schools emphasized how helpless and pitiable and emotional disabled kids were, especially uneducated kids. The advertisements often had religious imagery and potent visual imagery of donors literally uplifting the disabled children into light (very dramatic!). Even educators who did not believe in the emotional excess of disabled students (such as educator Anderson) still often used such imagery in their ads, to appeal to pathos.

There was much social discussion regarding whether disabled children (I guess there must be some discussion regarding the level of disability?) could be educated and become useful members of society at all.

The conversation of “who deserves charity and who is just faking it” pervaded the political discourse as well. In Elizabethan times, visibly disabled folks were sent to poor houses / asylums, paupers who were willing to work were provided jobs through the parish, and paupers unwilling to work were sent to jail / punishment. This system didn’t work out well because there was a great increase in the poorhouses that did not reflect a greater need for poorhouses (but rather people simply going to the poorhouses?)

**Going into the 19th century, there became tests of eligibility for entry into the poor houses, with the goal that fewer paupers would go seek resources from the poor houses.** Of course, this enforced the dichotomy of the innocent “deserves” and guilty “undeserves”

**The Poor Law 1834 basically said that able-bodied paupers could only seek shelter in the workhouses, where conditions were purposely made horrible so they would be discouraged from entering.**

Although there were efforts by Chadwick to separate out poor houses by disability / gender / age, it was ultimately more economical to house everyone in the same workhouse (these capitalists!!), and disabled people often did not get the accommodations they needed to thrive in these workhouses. Of course, **by having a single house to house all the guilty people (remember if you really had a disability, you would probably be placed in an asylum or given charitable aid), the workhouse enforced the dichotomy between the innocents and the guilty.**

Although there were often ample charitable funds for the disabled, there grew to be a fear of swindlers swindling innocent wealthy people into giving undeserved alms. To that end, **the Charity Organization Society (SOC) was formed in 1869 to determine, often case-b-case, which paupers truly deserved alms and which didn’t. Of course, these determinations were often less scientific and more based on sympathy and the aforementioned dichotomy.**

The distinction between who deserved aid and who didn’t gradually grew more tenuous, as disabled people were sometimes classified as being undeserving of charity as well. **Chalmers came up with this horribly ingenious idea where the loudest paupers proclaiming disability / need of alms were the ones that were the fakers of disability, and thus alms should not be given to them.** Thus, disabled people were sidelined, where advocacy for themselves was seen as performative / excessive; for those truly too disabled to advocate for themselves, their voices were silent and could not be heard. **Thus, normal society felt like it had done its share in sympathizing with the truly disabled, since the loudest voices were not to be sympathized with, and those truly in need of alms would have no voice.**

**Chalmers’ suggestion of performative disability led to the side effect of people with visible disabilities being favored for alms / sympathy;** in a way, people with visible disabilities didn’t need to perform their disability, but it was evident enough that they could be unequivocally seen as disabled. This probably relates to today’s stigma of invisible illness too... hm...... :(((

Charities and sympathy toward disabled people often imagined these disabled people on the fringes of life, and it profaned them to see disabled people trying to incorporate themselves into the normal productive economy. For example, when one blind man (this story is real-life) tried to make a living creating mats and failed, he was denied all charity afterwards, because he had attempted to make himself useful and integrate into society.

**Indeed, many of these charities focused less on the well-being of these poor people, and more on the donors’ sense of sympathy and feel-good sentiments.** For example, when a blind advocacy group suggested that they would rather learn to work than learn to beg of the charities, the charities got very upset.**
