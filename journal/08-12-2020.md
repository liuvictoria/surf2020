I will be presenting next Friday in the summer symposium. Of course, I will have two more weeks of work after that, but I felt like presenting in the summer suited my interests better--I will probably remember more about my research next week, than on a random weekend in October.
Anyway, I've been thinking about the order in which I want to present everything, as well as how to structure my final paper. To these ends, I've been looking for good graphics for the powerpoint
(I've found many interesting Dickens illustrations that I will probably include). I'm trying to figure out the balance between my introduction and my literary analysis of the books I've read. I will probably spend every day until next Wednesday (which is when the presentation is due) figuring everything out.

In the meantime, I've also been getting a little bit of *Dombey and Son* reading done as well, since I want to finish the book! LOL!
